                It seemed prudent to give a quick, high level explanation of how the Resource Library is 
                assembled and organized, because changes are occasionally necessary, and if the necessary
                files are not updated properly, some or all of the resources will become inaccessible and 
                it can sometimes be incredibly challenging to track down those sorts of problems if you don't
                know which areas should be checked.
                Ultimately, all XAML resources are compiled into this main ResourceDictionary which 
                immediately follows this comment. But there are several intermediate merged dictionaries
                that are compiled along the way. The hierarchy is as follows:
     
                    App.xaml
                    |-> Resources.xaml
                        |-> ApplicationCommands.xaml
                        |   |-> Any Command types that need to be accessible anywhere in the application, and
                        |       can function properly using only static references (Ostensibly stateless)
                        |
                        |-> Icons.xaml
                        |   |-> Any resources defined in a XAML ResourceDictionary in the Icons folder and its subfolders
                        | 
                        |-> Styles.xaml
                            |-> Any resources defined in a XAML ResourceDictionary in the Styles fold and its subfolders
                    
                This tree should be kept as up to date as possible just to protect against any problems that might
                arise with the merged dictionaries in the future.
